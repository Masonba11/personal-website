          My journey is driven by an intrinsic motivation to create and
          innovate. As a sophomore at Chandler-Gilbert Community College, I'm
          not just pursuing a degree in Applied Data Analytics and Computer
          Programming – I'm building a foundation for a future where technology
          and business intersect seamlessly. My passion for learning and growth
          is matched only by my commitment to excellence in everything I do.

          Running a successful business while maintaining a 3.85 GPA isn't just
          about time management – it's about passion and purpose. My business
          ventures have taught me invaluable lessons in leadership,
          problem-solving, and strategic thinking. These experiences complement
          my academic journey, creating a well-rounded foundation for future
          success.

            I call Queen Creek, Arizona home, where I'm surrounded by a family
            that's deeply rooted in both business and technology. My father runs
            a marketing agency with expertise in SEO, while my mother works as
            an esthetician. My older brother is a senior-level software engineer
            at Booz Allen Hamilton, providing me with valuable insights into the
            tech industry.

            At home, our two basset hounds keep things lively with their
            distinctive howls – they're a constant source of joy and
            entertainment. When I'm not studying or working on my business,
            you'll find me cheering for the Philadelphia Eagles or hitting the
            slopes for some snowboarding.
